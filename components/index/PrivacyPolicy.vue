        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that you understand
        it. By using any of our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If
        you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this
        Policy, you must stop using our Services immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="important-content mb-[1.875rem]">
        In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data
        is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We do not sell
        your data.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h1">1. Scope of this Privacy Policy</p>
      <p class="content">
        This Privacy Policy applies only to our collection and processing of
        information about users of the Services. This Privacy Policy does not
        apply to any services, websites or software operated by third parties
        that are linked to us (whether we provide those links or other users
        share them) nor does it apply to content, data, applications or
        materials from third parties. We advise you to check the privacy
        policies of any third party website or software before providing any
        information to them.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h1">2. What we collect and why</p>
      <p class="content">
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that
        means in practice:
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.1 Identity & access</p>
      <p class="content">
        When you sign up for one of our products, we ask for identifying
        information such as your name, email address. This is to provide
        essential product functionality and so we can send you product updates
        and other essential information.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.2 Billing information</p>
      <p class="content">
        If you sign up for a paid product, you will be asked to provide your
        payment information and billing address. Payment information is
        submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn’t hit our servers.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.3 Product interactions</p>
      <p class="content">
        We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or
        maintain in your product accounts. Unless you delete this content, we
        may keep this content as long as your account is active.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.4 Website interactions</p>
      <p class="content">
        We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and
        statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting
        with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and
        operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited
        and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If
        you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied
        to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer
        active.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.5 Cookies</p>
      <p class="content">
        We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies
        to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our
        applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember
        login information and site preferences. It might also collect
        information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages
        visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data.
        You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual
        cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won’t work and other
        aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies
        off.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h3">2.6 Voluntary correspondence</p>
      <p class="content">
        When you email us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that
        correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history
        of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h1">3. When we access or share your information</p>
      <p class="content">
        To provide products or services you’ve requested. We use some
        third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the
        Services to you. This includes cloud and analytics providers.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding abuse. Accessing a
        customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of
        last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our
        customers and the people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to
        balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we discover
        you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action
        as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where
        warranted.
      </p>
      <p class="content">When required under applicable law.</p>
      <p class="content">
        - Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government
        requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in
        limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if
        U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal
        subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, we must comply.
        Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities
        outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures
        outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is our
        policy to notify affected users before we share data unless we are
        legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        - Preservation requests. Similarly, our policy is to comply with
        requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored
        Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served
        U.S. subpoena for civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless
        required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not to
        appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or
        subpoena before the required preservation period expires, we will
        destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the
        preservation period.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        - If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share
        billing-related information. If that happens, we will share only the
        minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.
      </p>
      <p class="title-h1">4. How we secure your data</p>
      <p class="content">
        All data is encrypted via
